                <p><span class="b-letter">M</span>y bio in a nutshell... <br>Born in the former USSR, where I majored in music (Masters degree in Musicology) and freelanced as an illustrator. Emigrated to the USA in 1976. Learned computer programming and made my living working in the corporate IT world (mostly, on Wall St.) since the early 80s. Also, freelanced as an illustrator, took part in several art exhibitions during this period. Relocated to PA in 2005. Currently, I reside in Churchville, (Bucks Co.) with my husband and two cats. I paint, illustrate, design and give private art lessons. I exhibit and sell my artwork (mostly, online), as well as work on commission. </p>
                <p>As an artist, I am enjoying complete artistic freedom that brings to my work the whole gamut of concepts, moods, emotions and fantasies. I see beauty in just about everything and enjoy showing it through my art. I work with various media (acrylic paints, watercolors and ink being my favorite). My work covers a wide range of subjects (from deeply philosophical to humorous, from the ones dedicated to a purpose to the ones with no purpose other than simple decorative pleasure). Some of my artwork was created with children in mind, while other is adult-oriented. Artistically, I am very versatile and always work from my imagination. </p>
                <p>I'm a member of the Society of Children Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI), and an artwork contributor on www.literacyhead.com (a unique e-publication that promotes literacy through use of visual art among children) </p>
